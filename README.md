# FoodApp

In this app I focused on implementing an interactive & beautiful design for a sample food ordering app!

It's still an uncomplete project but good enough for my purpose!

It can be continued if backedup by an API...!


## Features
- User login (via username || google || facebook) & register (OTP) procedure implementation
- Intro slider
- ready to connect to the business logic and a repository for dynamic data
- Food preview 
- Full menu preview
- Viewing profile
- Searching among all foods & restaurants (todo -> repository)
- Viewing restaurants on the map (todo)
- Cart ordering and payment stuff (todo)
- Notifying user for the order's process (todo)
- Selecting current location for the order (todo)
- Profile customization (todo)
